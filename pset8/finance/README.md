# CS50 Finance

This is pset7 from the HarvardX course CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.
I was supposed to create new functions and templates for buying, selling and quoting stock prices, as well as a portfolio page.
The site connects to the Yahoo Finance API to get data.
The database used is SQL.
